## Install

Eventually you will be able to install the package `language-arnoldc` in Atom's built in package manager. However, at this time you must download the files and link the folder with Atom's Package Manager like so:

```bash
$ apm link
```

###### Notes
 - There is certainly going to be a lot of bugs, this was done in under an hour. 
 - The highlighting looks better in darker themes such as Seti and Monokai themes. 
 - This is software is **unlicensed**, do whatever you want with it.
